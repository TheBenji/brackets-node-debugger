#Brackets Node.JS Debugger

Brackets-node-debugger is an extension for the [Brackets](http://brackets.io) editor.

It's an early stage step-by-step debugger for Node.js applications.

Install it
------

Use the built-in Brackets Extension Manager to install __Node.JS Debugger__
_or_ clone this repository into your Extension folder

You need to __restart__ (not just reload) Brackets after the installation!

How to use it
-------

Start your script with `node --debug-brk yor-script.js` _or_ `node --debug your-script.js`

Go into Brackets and click on `Debug -> Node.js Debugger`

Click on the red icon at the top left corner to activate the debugger and connect it to your script.
